This is the major assignment for our optomechanical structural design course. Thanks a lot for Xiaowen Wang, Longxun Cao and Hanmo Mei. That  week we all had little time for sleep and we finally made a really big guy! Although that period was very hard , I really cherish it.

I will make it more detailed when I have time.
